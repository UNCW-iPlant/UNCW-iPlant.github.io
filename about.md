#What is iPlant@UNCW for?

This site is designed to help new recruits to [CyVerse](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/) learn their way around the various infrastructures, 
services, and programs that they will most likely use. Quite simply, it contains everything that we wish we had known back when we were first starting out. 
It's possible you may be overwhelmed upon learning about all that iPlant has to offer, but rest assured, new recruit, after spending some time here, you'll be creating images and
submitting HPC jobs like a boss!

#Why did we make CyVerse@UNCW?

While working at CyVerse is a great opportunity, it's easy to get confused on what exactly you need to know or where to start. To tell the truth, there's a lot of information being thrown up at once, not all of which may
be useful in the long run. Though some may view this approach as a "sink or swim" method of learning, we feel that this method is not for everyone. Our goal is to filter out the important
information, break these parts down into accessible, step-by-step walkthroughs, and ease new users in such that anyone can learn his/her way around the iPlant infrastructure.
