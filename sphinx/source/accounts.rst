What's an API?

Create an account at https://portal.xsede.org/

To get access to the Agave API, you must request an allocation from XSEDE. This allocation will give you access to the actual compute resources on Stampede and give the Stampede system to "bill" you, so to speak, for any jobs run on said system. For example, staff at iPlant have access to the "iPlant-Collabs" project. To request a standard XSEDE allocation, follow the step-by-step instructions found at https://portal.xsede.org/allocation-request-steps. If you are a staff member at the iPlant Collaborative, send a message to support@iplantcollaborative.org to request access to the "iPlant-Collabs" allocation. Note that you will not immediately receive a notification upon getting access.
