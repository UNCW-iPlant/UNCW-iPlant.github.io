Setting up your accounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you start using any of the tools available through CyVerse you must first set up accounts with CyVerse, TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center), XSEDE (Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment) as well as requesting allocations for access to the Agave API.

You'll also need several accounts on common project-management websites (github, trello, slack).
